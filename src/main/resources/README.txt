Hello and welcome.
This is eazy peezy tutorial for my semestral project - 
SCHOOL INFORMATION SYSTEM.

Here are some helpful tips on how my app works:

RETURN CODES
---OK---
0 - Everything is fine! :)
2 - You pressed "X" on login page
3 - You pressed "X" on admin section or logged out
4 - You pressed "X" on student section or logged out
5 - Logger did not work properly, but app will start!



---Not OK---
1 - general error, happens when you do something you cannot
6 - Logger did not work at all
100 - not connected to database
666 - Something went really wrong.

Feel free to use my app, its very simple.
